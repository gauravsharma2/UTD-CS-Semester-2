Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,',\n 'it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the',\n 'time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a',\n 'watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried',\n 'on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she',\n 'had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a',\n 'watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the',\n 'field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a',\n 'large rabbit-hole under the hedge.',\n '',\n 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how',\n 'in the world she was to get out again.',\n '',\n 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then',\n 'dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think',\n 'about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very',\n 'deep well.',\n '',\n 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had',\n 'plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what',\n 'was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out',\n 'what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she',\n 'looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with',\n 'cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures',\n 'hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she',\n 'passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great',\n 'disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear',\n 'of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the',\n 'cupboards as she fell past it.',\n '',\n '“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall',\n 'think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me',\n 'at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the',\n 'top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)',\n '',\n 'Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how',\n 'many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be',\n 'getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would',\n 'be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt',\n 'several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and',\n 'though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her',\n 'knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good',\n 'practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but',\n 'then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no',\n 'idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice',\n 'grand words to say.)',\n '',\n 'Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_',\n 'the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk',\n 'with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather',\n 'glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all',\n 'the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the',\n 'country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”',\n '(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re',\n 'falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what',\n 'an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do',\n 'to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”',\n '',\n 'Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began',\n 'talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”',\n '(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at',\n 'tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are',\n 'no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s',\n 'very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here',\n 'Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a',\n 'dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and',\n 'sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer',\n 'either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt',\n 'that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was',\n 'walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,',\n '“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,',\n 'thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and',\n 'the fall was over.',\n '',\n 'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:',\n 'she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another',\n 'long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down',\n 'it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,',\n 'and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears',\n 'and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she',\n 'turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found',\n 'herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging',\n 'from the roof.',\n '',\n 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when',\n 'Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every',\n 'door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to',\n 'get out again.',\n '',\n 'Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid',\n 'glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s',\n 'first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;',\n 'but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,',\n 'but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second',\n 'time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and',\n 'behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the',\n 'little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!',\n '',\n 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not',\n 'much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the',\n 'passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get',\n 'out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright',\n 'flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head',\n 'through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought',\n 'poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,',\n 'how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only',\n 'knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had',\n 'happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things',\n 'indeed were really impossible.',\n '',\n 'There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went',\n 'back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at',\n 'any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this',\n 'time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here',\n 'before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper',\n 'label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large',\n 'letters.',\n '',\n 'It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was',\n 'not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,',\n '“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read',\n 'several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and',\n 'eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they',\n '_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:',\n 'such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;',\n 'and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually',\n 'bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a',\n 'bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,',\n 'sooner or later.',\n '',\n 'However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to',\n 'taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed',\n 'flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and',\n 'hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '    *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '',\n '“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a',\n 'telescope.”',\n '',\n 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face',\n 'brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going',\n 'through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she',\n 'waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:',\n 'she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”',\n 'said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I',\n 'wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the',\n 'flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could',\n 'not remember ever having seen such a thing.',\n '',\n 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going',\n 'into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the',\n 'door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she',\n 'went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach',\n 'it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her',\n 'best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;',\n 'and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing',\n 'sat down and cried.',\n '',\n '“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,',\n 'rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally',\n 'gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),',\n 'and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into',\n 'her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having',\n 'cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,',\n 'for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n '“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two',\n 'people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable',\n 'person!”',\n '',\n 'Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:',\n 'she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words',\n '“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said',\n 'Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it',\n 'makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll',\n 'get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”',\n '',\n 'She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which',\n 'way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was',\n 'growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same',\n 'size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice',\n 'had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way',\n 'things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go',\n 'on in the common way.',\n '',\n 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '    *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER II.',\n 'The Pool of Tears',\n '',\n '',\n '“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that',\n 'for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m',\n 'opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”',\n '(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of',\n 'sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I',\n 'wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m',\n 'sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble',\n 'myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be',\n 'kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I',\n 'want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every',\n 'Christmas.”',\n '',\n 'And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must',\n 'go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending',\n 'presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!',\n '',\n '     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with',\n '     Alice’s love_).',\n '',\n 'Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”',\n '',\n 'Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was',\n 'now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden',\n 'key and hurried off to the garden door.',\n '',\n 'Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to',\n 'look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more',\n 'hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.',\n '',\n '“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like',\n 'you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop',\n 'this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding',\n 'gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about',\n 'four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.',\n '',\n 'After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and',\n 'she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White',\n 'Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves',\n 'in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a',\n 'great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the',\n 'Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt',\n 'so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the',\n 'Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,',\n 'sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and',\n 'the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.',\n '',\n 'Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she',\n 'kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How',\n 'queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.',\n 'I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the',\n 'same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling',\n 'a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who',\n 'in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began',\n 'thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as',\n 'herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.',\n '',\n '“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long',\n 'ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t',\n 'be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a',\n 'very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how',\n 'puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.',\n 'Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,',\n 'and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that',\n 'rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try',\n 'Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of',\n 'Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been',\n 'changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she',\n 'crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began',\n 'to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words',\n 'did not come the same as they used to do:—',\n '',\n '“How doth the little crocodile',\n '    Improve his shining tail,',\n 'And pour the waters of the Nile',\n '    On every golden scale!',\n '',\n '“How cheerfully he seems to grin,',\n '    How neatly spread his claws,',\n 'And welcome little fishes in',\n '    With gently smiling jaws!”',\n '',\n '',\n '“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes',\n 'filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and',\n 'I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to',\n 'no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve',\n 'made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be',\n 'no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’',\n 'I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and',\n 'then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down',\n 'here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden',\n 'burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so',\n '_very_ tired of being all alone here!”',\n '',\n 'As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see',\n 'that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while',\n 'she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be',\n 'growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure',\n 'herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was',\n 'now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon',\n 'found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she',\n 'dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.',\n '',\n '“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the',\n 'sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and',\n 'now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little',\n 'door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden',\n 'key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than',\n 'ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this',\n 'before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”',\n '',\n 'As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,',\n 'splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that',\n 'she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by',\n 'railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in',\n 'her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go',\n 'to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the',\n 'sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row',\n 'of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she',\n 'soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when',\n 'she was nine feet high.',\n '',\n '“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying',\n 'to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by',\n 'being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be',\n 'sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”',\n '',\n 'Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way',\n 'off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought',\n 'it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small',\n 'she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had',\n 'slipped in like herself.',\n '',\n '“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?',\n 'Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very',\n 'likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she',\n 'began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired',\n 'of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right',\n 'way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but',\n 'she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of',\n 'a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather',\n 'inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,',\n 'but it said nothing.',\n '',\n '“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s',\n 'a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all',\n 'her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago',\n 'anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which',\n 'was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a',\n 'sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with',\n 'fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she',\n 'had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like',\n 'cats.”',\n '',\n '“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would',\n '_you_ like cats if you were me?”',\n '',\n '“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry',\n 'about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d',\n 'take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear',\n 'quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about',\n 'in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her',\n 'paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to',\n 'nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your',\n 'pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all',\n 'over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk',\n 'about her any more if you’d rather not.”',\n '',\n '“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his',\n 'tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always',\n '_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name',\n 'again!”',\n '',\n '“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of',\n 'conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not',\n 'answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near',\n 'our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you',\n 'know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when',\n 'you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts',\n 'of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you',\n 'know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says',\n 'it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,',\n '“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away',\n 'from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the',\n 'pool as it went.',\n '',\n 'So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we',\n 'won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the',\n 'Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face',\n 'was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low',\n 'trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my',\n 'history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”',\n '',\n 'It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the',\n 'birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a',\n 'Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice',\n 'led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER III.',\n 'A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale',\n '',\n '',\n 'They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the',\n 'birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close',\n 'to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.',\n '',\n 'The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a',\n 'consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite',\n 'natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if',\n 'she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument',\n 'with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am',\n 'older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow',\n 'without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to',\n 'tell its age, there was no more to be said.',\n '',\n 'At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,',\n 'called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make',\n 'you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the',\n 'Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she',\n 'felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.',\n '',\n '“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This',\n 'is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William',\n 'the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted',\n 'to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much',\n 'accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of',\n 'Mercia and Northumbria—’”',\n '',\n '“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.',\n '',\n '“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did',\n 'you speak?”',\n '',\n '“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.',\n '',\n '“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,',\n 'the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even',\n 'Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”',\n '',\n '“Found _what_?” said the Duck.',\n '',\n '“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know',\n 'what ‘it’ means.”',\n '',\n '“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the',\n 'Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the',\n 'archbishop find?”',\n '',\n 'The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found',\n 'it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him',\n 'the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence',\n 'of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,',\n 'turning to Alice as it spoke.',\n '',\n '“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to',\n 'dry me at all.”',\n '',\n '“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move',\n 'that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic',\n 'remedies—”',\n '',\n '“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half',\n 'those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And',\n 'the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds',\n 'tittered audibly.',\n '',\n '“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,',\n 'that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”',\n '',\n '“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to',\n 'know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to',\n 'speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.',\n '',\n '“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,',\n 'as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will',\n 'tell you how the Dodo managed it.)',\n '',\n 'First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact',\n 'shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed',\n 'along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and',\n 'away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they',\n 'liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,',\n 'when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry',\n 'again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all',\n 'crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”',\n '',\n 'This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of',\n 'thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its',\n 'forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the',\n 'pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo',\n 'said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”',\n '',\n '“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.',\n '',\n '“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one',\n 'finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a',\n 'confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”',\n '',\n 'Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her',\n 'pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had',\n 'not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly',\n 'one a-piece, all round.',\n '',\n '“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.',\n '',\n '“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in',\n 'your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.',\n '',\n '“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.',\n '',\n '“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.',\n '',\n 'Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly',\n 'presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant',\n 'thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all',\n 'cheered.',\n '',\n 'Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave',\n 'that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything',\n 'to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as',\n 'she could.',\n '',\n 'The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and',\n 'confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste',\n 'theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.',\n 'However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and',\n 'begged the Mouse to tell them something more.',\n '',\n '“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why',\n 'it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it',\n 'would be offended again.',\n '',\n '“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and',\n 'sighing.',\n '',\n '“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder',\n 'at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on',\n 'puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the',\n 'tale was something like this:—',\n '',\n '         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both',\n '         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no',\n '         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve',\n '         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear',\n '         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’',\n '         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll',\n '         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”',\n '',\n '“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are',\n 'you thinking of?”',\n '',\n '“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth',\n 'bend, I think?”',\n '',\n '“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.',\n '',\n '“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking',\n 'anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”',\n '',\n '“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and',\n 'walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”',\n '',\n '“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,',\n 'you know!”',\n '',\n 'The Mouse only growled in reply.',\n '',\n '“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and',\n 'the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only',\n 'shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.',\n '',\n '“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was',\n 'quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to',\n 'her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose',\n '_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little',\n 'snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”',\n '',\n '“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,',\n 'addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”',\n '',\n '“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the',\n 'Lory.',\n '',\n 'Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:',\n '“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you',\n 'can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,',\n 'she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”',\n '',\n 'This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the',\n 'birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very',\n 'carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air',\n 'doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice',\n 'to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in',\n 'bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left',\n 'alone.',\n '',\n '“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy',\n 'tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best',\n 'cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you',\n 'any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very',\n 'lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a',\n 'little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up',\n 'eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was',\n 'coming back to finish his story.',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER IV.',\n 'The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill',\n '',\n '',\n 'It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking',\n 'anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard',\n 'it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh',\n 'my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are',\n 'ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a',\n 'moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid',\n 'gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but',\n 'they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since',\n 'her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the',\n 'little door, had vanished completely.',\n '',\n 'Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and',\n 'called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you',\n 'doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and',\n 'a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off',\n 'at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the',\n 'mistake it had made.',\n '',\n '“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How',\n 'surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him',\n 'his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she',\n 'came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass',\n 'plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without',\n 'knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the',\n 'real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the',\n 'fan and gloves.',\n '',\n '“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for',\n 'a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she',\n 'began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come',\n 'here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,',\n 'nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I',\n 'don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house',\n 'if it began ordering people about like that!”',\n '',\n 'By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table',\n 'in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three',\n 'pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the',\n 'gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a',\n 'little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label',\n 'this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it',\n 'and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to',\n 'happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so',\n 'I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large',\n 'again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”',\n '',\n 'It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had',\n 'drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,',\n 'and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put',\n 'down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t',\n 'grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t',\n 'drunk quite so much!”',\n '',\n 'Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,',\n 'and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there',\n 'was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with',\n 'one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.',\n 'Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out',\n 'of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I',\n 'can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”',\n '',\n 'Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,',\n 'and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there',\n 'seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room',\n 'again, no wonder she felt unhappy.',\n '',\n '“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t',\n 'always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and',\n 'rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and',\n 'yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what',\n '_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied',\n 'that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of',\n 'one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And',\n 'when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a',\n 'sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”',\n '',\n '“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am',\n 'now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but',\n 'then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”',\n '',\n '“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn',\n 'lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all',\n 'for any lesson-books!”',\n '',\n 'And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and',\n 'making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes',\n 'she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.',\n '',\n '“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”',\n 'Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was',\n 'the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the',\n 'house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as',\n 'large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.',\n '',\n 'Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as',\n 'the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,',\n 'that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll',\n 'go round and get in at the window.”',\n '',\n '“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied',\n 'she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her',\n 'hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,',\n 'but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,',\n 'from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a',\n 'cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.',\n '',\n 'Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And',\n 'then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging',\n 'for apples, yer honour!”',\n '',\n '“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and',\n 'help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)',\n '',\n '“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”',\n '',\n '“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)',\n '',\n '“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole',\n 'window!”',\n '',\n '“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”',\n '',\n '“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”',\n '',\n 'There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers',\n 'now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at',\n 'all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her',\n 'hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were',\n '_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number',\n 'of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what',\n 'they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they',\n '_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”',\n '',\n 'She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a',\n 'rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all',\n 'talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other',\n 'ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!',\n 'fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em',\n 'together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do',\n 'well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this',\n 'rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!',\n 'Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I',\n 'fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do',\n 'it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says',\n 'you’re to go down the chimney!”',\n '',\n '“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to',\n 'herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in',\n 'Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but',\n 'I _think_ I can kick a little!”',\n '',\n 'She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till',\n 'she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)',\n 'scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,',\n 'saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited',\n 'to see what would happen next.',\n '',\n 'The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”',\n 'then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then',\n 'silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy',\n 'now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell',\n 'us all about it!”',\n '',\n 'Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought',\n 'Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m',\n 'a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me',\n 'like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”',\n '',\n '“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.',\n '',\n '“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice',\n 'called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”',\n '',\n 'There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I',\n 'wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the',\n 'roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and',\n 'Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”',\n '',\n '“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,',\n 'for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the',\n 'window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to',\n 'this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that',\n 'again!” which produced another dead silence.',\n '',\n 'Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into',\n 'little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her',\n 'head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make',\n '_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it',\n 'must make me smaller, I suppose.”',\n '',\n 'So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she',\n 'began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get',\n 'through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of',\n 'little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,',\n 'was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it',\n 'something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she',\n 'appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself',\n 'safe in a thick wood.',\n '',\n '“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she',\n 'wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the',\n 'second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that',\n 'will be the best plan.”',\n '',\n 'It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply',\n 'arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea',\n 'how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among',\n 'the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a',\n 'great hurry.',\n '',\n 'An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and',\n 'feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little',\n 'thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to',\n 'it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it',\n 'might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in',\n 'spite of all her coaxing.',\n '',\n 'Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and',\n 'held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off',\n 'all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,',\n 'and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,',\n 'to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the',\n 'other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head',\n 'over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was',\n 'very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every',\n 'moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then',\n 'the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very',\n 'little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely',\n 'all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with',\n 'its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.',\n '',\n 'This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she',\n 'set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,',\n 'and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.',\n '',\n '“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant',\n 'against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the',\n 'leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d',\n 'only been the right size to do it!

Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,',\n 'it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the',\n 'time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a',\n 'watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried',\n 'on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she',\n 'had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a',\n 'watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the',\n 'field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a',\n 'large rabbit-hole under the hedge.',\n '',\n 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how',\n 'in the world she was to get out again.',\n '',\n 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then',\n 'dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think',\n 'about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very',\n 'deep well.',\n '',\n 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had',\n 'plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what',\n 'was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out',\n 'what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she',\n 'looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with',\n 'cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures',\n 'hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she',\n 'passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great',\n 'disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear',\n 'of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the',\n 'cupboards as she fell past it.',\n '',\n '“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall',\n 'think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me',\n 'at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the',\n 'top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)',\n '',\n 'Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how',\n 'many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be',\n 'getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would',\n 'be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt',\n 'several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and',\n 'though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her',\n 'knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good',\n 'practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but',\n 'then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no',\n 'idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice',\n 'grand words to say.)',\n '',\n 'Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_',\n 'the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk',\n 'with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather',\n 'glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all',\n 'the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the',\n 'country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”',\n '(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re',\n 'falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what',\n 'an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do',\n 'to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”',\n '',\n 'Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began',\n 'talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”',\n '(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at',\n 'tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are',\n 'no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s',\n 'very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here',\n 'Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a',\n 'dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and',\n 'sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer',\n 'either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt',\n 'that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was',\n 'walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,',\n '“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,',\n 'thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and',\n 'the fall was over.',\n '',\n 'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:',\n 'she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another',\n 'long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down',\n 'it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,',\n 'and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears',\n 'and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she',\n 'turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found',\n 'herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging',\n 'from the roof.',\n '',\n 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when',\n 'Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every',\n 'door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to',\n 'get out again.',\n '',\n 'Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid',\n 'glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s',\n 'first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;',\n 'but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,',\n 'but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second',\n 'time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and',\n 'behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the',\n 'little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!',\n '',\n 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not',\n 'much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the',\n 'passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get',\n 'out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright',\n 'flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head',\n 'through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought',\n 'poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,',\n 'how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only',\n 'knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had',\n 'happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things',\n 'indeed were really impossible.',\n '',\n 'There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went',\n 'back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at',\n 'any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this',\n 'time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here',\n 'before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper',\n 'label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large',\n 'letters.',\n '',\n 'It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was',\n 'not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,',\n '“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read',\n 'several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and',\n 'eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they',\n '_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:',\n 'such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;',\n 'and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually',\n 'bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a',\n 'bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,',\n 'sooner or later.',\n '',\n 'However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to',\n 'taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed',\n 'flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and',\n 'hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '    *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '',\n '“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a',\n 'telescope.”',\n '',\n 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face',\n 'brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going',\n 'through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she',\n 'waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:',\n 'she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”',\n 'said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I',\n 'wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the',\n 'flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could',\n 'not remember ever having seen such a thing.',\n '',\n 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going',\n 'into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the',\n 'door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she',\n 'went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach',\n 'it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her',\n 'best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;',\n 'and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing',\n 'sat down and cried.',\n '',\n '“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,',\n 'rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally',\n 'gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),',\n 'and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into',\n 'her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having',\n 'cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,',\n 'for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n '“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two',\n 'people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable',\n 'person!”',\n '',\n 'Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:',\n 'she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words',\n '“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said',\n 'Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it',\n 'makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll',\n 'get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”',\n '',\n 'She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which',\n 'way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was',\n 'growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same',\n 'size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice',\n 'had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way',\n 'things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go',\n 'on in the common way.',\n '',\n 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '    *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '*      *      *      *      *      *      *',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER II.',\n 'The Pool of Tears',\n '',\n '',\n '“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that',\n 'for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m',\n 'opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”',\n '(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of',\n 'sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I',\n 'wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m',\n 'sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble',\n 'myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be',\n 'kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I',\n 'want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every',\n 'Christmas.”',\n '',\n 'And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must',\n 'go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending',\n 'presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!',\n '',\n '     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with',\n '     Alice’s love_).',\n '',\n 'Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”',\n '',\n 'Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was',\n 'now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden',\n 'key and hurried off to the garden door.',\n '',\n 'Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to',\n 'look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more',\n 'hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.',\n '',\n '“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like',\n 'you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop',\n 'this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding',\n 'gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about',\n 'four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.',\n '',\n 'After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and',\n 'she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White',\n 'Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves',\n 'in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a',\n 'great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the',\n 'Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt',\n 'so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the',\n 'Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,',\n 'sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and',\n 'the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.',\n '',\n 'Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she',\n 'kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How',\n 'queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.',\n 'I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the',\n 'same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling',\n 'a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who',\n 'in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began',\n 'thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as',\n 'herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.',\n '',\n '“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long',\n 'ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t',\n 'be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a',\n 'very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how',\n 'puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.',\n 'Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,',\n 'and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that',\n 'rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try',\n 'Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of',\n 'Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been',\n 'changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she',\n 'crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began',\n 'to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words',\n 'did not come the same as they used to do:—',\n '',\n '“How doth the little crocodile',\n '    Improve his shining tail,',\n 'And pour the waters of the Nile',\n '    On every golden scale!',\n '',\n '“How cheerfully he seems to grin,',\n '    How neatly spread his claws,',\n 'And welcome little fishes in',\n '    With gently smiling jaws!”',\n '',\n '',\n '“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes',\n 'filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and',\n 'I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to',\n 'no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve',\n 'made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be',\n 'no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’',\n 'I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and',\n 'then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down',\n 'here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden',\n 'burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so',\n '_very_ tired of being all alone here!”',\n '',\n 'As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see',\n 'that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while',\n 'she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be',\n 'growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure',\n 'herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was',\n 'now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon',\n 'found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she',\n 'dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.',\n '',\n '“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the',\n 'sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and',\n 'now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little',\n 'door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden',\n 'key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than',\n 'ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this',\n 'before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”',\n '',\n 'As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,',\n 'splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that',\n 'she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by',\n 'railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in',\n 'her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go',\n 'to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the',\n 'sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row',\n 'of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she',\n 'soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when',\n 'she was nine feet high.',\n '',\n '“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying',\n 'to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by',\n 'being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be',\n 'sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”',\n '',\n 'Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way',\n 'off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought',\n 'it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small',\n 'she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had',\n 'slipped in like herself.',\n '',\n '“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?',\n 'Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very',\n 'likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she',\n 'began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired',\n 'of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right',\n 'way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but',\n 'she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of',\n 'a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather',\n 'inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,',\n 'but it said nothing.',\n '',\n '“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s',\n 'a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all',\n 'her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago',\n 'anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which',\n 'was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a',\n 'sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with',\n 'fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she',\n 'had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like',\n 'cats.”',\n '',\n '“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would',\n '_you_ like cats if you were me?”',\n '',\n '“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry',\n 'about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d',\n 'take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear',\n 'quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about',\n 'in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her',\n 'paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to',\n 'nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your',\n 'pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all',\n 'over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk',\n 'about her any more if you’d rather not.”',\n '',\n '“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his',\n 'tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always',\n '_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name',\n 'again!”',\n '',\n '“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of',\n 'conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not',\n 'answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near',\n 'our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you',\n 'know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when',\n 'you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts',\n 'of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you',\n 'know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says',\n 'it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,',\n '“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away',\n 'from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the',\n 'pool as it went.',\n '',\n 'So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we',\n 'won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the',\n 'Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face',\n 'was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low',\n 'trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my',\n 'history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”',\n '',\n 'It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the',\n 'birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a',\n 'Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice',\n 'led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER III.',\n 'A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale',\n '',\n '',\n 'They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the',\n 'birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close',\n 'to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.',\n '',\n 'The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a',\n 'consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite',\n 'natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if',\n 'she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument',\n 'with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am',\n 'older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow',\n 'without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to',\n 'tell its age, there was no more to be said.',\n '',\n 'At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,',\n 'called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make',\n 'you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the',\n 'Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she',\n 'felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.',\n '',\n '“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This',\n 'is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William',\n 'the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted',\n 'to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much',\n 'accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of',\n 'Mercia and Northumbria—’”',\n '',\n '“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.',\n '',\n '“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did',\n 'you speak?”',\n '',\n '“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.',\n '',\n '“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,',\n 'the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even',\n 'Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”',\n '',\n '“Found _what_?” said the Duck.',\n '',\n '“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know',\n 'what ‘it’ means.”',\n '',\n '“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the',\n 'Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the',\n 'archbishop find?”',\n '',\n 'The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found',\n 'it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him',\n 'the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence',\n 'of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,',\n 'turning to Alice as it spoke.',\n '',\n '“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to',\n 'dry me at all.”',\n '',\n '“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move',\n 'that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic',\n 'remedies—”',\n '',\n '“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half',\n 'those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And',\n 'the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds',\n 'tittered audibly.',\n '',\n '“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,',\n 'that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”',\n '',\n '“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to',\n 'know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to',\n 'speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.',\n '',\n '“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,',\n 'as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will',\n 'tell you how the Dodo managed it.)',\n '',\n 'First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact',\n 'shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed',\n 'along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and',\n 'away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they',\n 'liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,',\n 'when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry',\n 'again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all',\n 'crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”',\n '',\n 'This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of',\n 'thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its',\n 'forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the',\n 'pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo',\n 'said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”',\n '',\n '“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.',\n '',\n '“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one',\n 'finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a',\n 'confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”',\n '',\n 'Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her',\n 'pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had',\n 'not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly',\n 'one a-piece, all round.',\n '',\n '“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.',\n '',\n '“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in',\n 'your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.',\n '',\n '“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.',\n '',\n '“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.',\n '',\n 'Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly',\n 'presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant',\n 'thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all',\n 'cheered.',\n '',\n 'Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave',\n 'that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything',\n 'to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as',\n 'she could.',\n '',\n 'The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and',\n 'confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste',\n 'theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.',\n 'However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and',\n 'begged the Mouse to tell them something more.',\n '',\n '“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why',\n 'it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it',\n 'would be offended again.',\n '',\n '“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and',\n 'sighing.',\n '',\n '“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder',\n 'at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on',\n 'puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the',\n 'tale was something like this:—',\n '',\n '         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both',\n '         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no',\n '         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve',\n '         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear',\n '         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’',\n '         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll',\n '         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”',\n '',\n '“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are',\n 'you thinking of?”',\n '',\n '“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth',\n 'bend, I think?”',\n '',\n '“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.',\n '',\n '“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking',\n 'anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”',\n '',\n '“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and',\n 'walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”',\n '',\n '“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,',\n 'you know!”',\n '',\n 'The Mouse only growled in reply.',\n '',\n '“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and',\n 'the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only',\n 'shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.',\n '',\n '“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was',\n 'quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to',\n 'her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose',\n '_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little',\n 'snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”',\n '',\n '“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,',\n 'addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”',\n '',\n '“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the',\n 'Lory.',\n '',\n 'Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:',\n '“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you',\n 'can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,',\n 'she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”',\n '',\n 'This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the',\n 'birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very',\n 'carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air',\n 'doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice',\n 'to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in',\n 'bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left',\n 'alone.',\n '',\n '“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy',\n 'tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best',\n 'cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you',\n 'any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very',\n 'lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a',\n 'little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up',\n 'eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was',\n 'coming back to finish his story.',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER IV.',\n 'The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill',\n '',\n '',\n 'It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking',\n 'anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard',\n 'it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh',\n 'my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are',\n 'ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a',\n 'moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid',\n 'gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but',\n 'they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since',\n 'her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the',\n 'little door, had vanished completely.',\n '',\n 'Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and',\n 'called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you',\n 'doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and',\n 'a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off',\n 'at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the',\n 'mistake it had made.',\n '',\n '“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How',\n 'surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him',\n 'his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she',\n 'came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass',\n 'plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without',\n 'knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the',\n 'real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the',\n 'fan and gloves.',\n '',\n '“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for',\n 'a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she',\n 'began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come',\n 'here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,',\n 'nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I',\n 'don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house',\n 'if it began ordering people about like that!”',\n '',\n 'By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table',\n 'in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three',\n 'pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the',\n 'gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a',\n 'little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label',\n 'this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it',\n 'and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to',\n 'happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so',\n 'I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large',\n 'again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”',\n '',\n 'It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had',\n 'drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,',\n 'and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put',\n 'down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t',\n 'grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t',\n 'drunk quite so much!”',\n '',\n 'Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,',\n 'and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there',\n 'was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with',\n 'one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.',\n 'Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out',\n 'of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I',\n 'can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”',\n '',\n 'Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,',\n 'and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there',\n 'seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room',\n 'again, no wonder she felt unhappy.',\n '',\n '“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t',\n 'always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and',\n 'rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and',\n 'yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what',\n '_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied',\n 'that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of',\n 'one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And',\n 'when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a',\n 'sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”',\n '',\n '“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am',\n 'now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but',\n 'then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”',\n '',\n '“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn',\n 'lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all',\n 'for any lesson-books!”',\n '',\n 'And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and',\n 'making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes',\n 'she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.',\n '',\n '“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”',\n 'Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was',\n 'the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the',\n 'house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as',\n 'large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.',\n '',\n 'Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as',\n 'the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,',\n 'that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll',\n 'go round and get in at the window.”',\n '',\n '“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied',\n 'she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her',\n 'hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,',\n 'but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,',\n 'from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a',\n 'cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.',\n '',\n 'Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And',\n 'then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging',\n 'for apples, yer honour!”',\n '',\n '“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and',\n 'help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)',\n '',\n '“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”',\n '',\n '“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)',\n '',\n '“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole',\n 'window!”',\n '',\n '“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”',\n '',\n '“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”',\n '',\n 'There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers',\n 'now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at',\n 'all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her',\n 'hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were',\n '_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number',\n 'of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what',\n 'they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they',\n '_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”',\n '',\n 'She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a',\n 'rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all',\n 'talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other',\n 'ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!',\n 'fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em',\n 'together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do',\n 'well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this',\n 'rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!',\n 'Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I',\n 'fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do',\n 'it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says',\n 'you’re to go down the chimney!”',\n '',\n '“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to',\n 'herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in',\n 'Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but',\n 'I _think_ I can kick a little!”',\n '',\n 'She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till',\n 'she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)',\n 'scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,',\n 'saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited',\n 'to see what would happen next.',\n '',\n 'The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”',\n 'then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then',\n 'silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy',\n 'now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell',\n 'us all about it!”',\n '',\n 'Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought',\n 'Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m',\n 'a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me',\n 'like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”',\n '',\n '“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.',\n '',\n '“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice',\n 'called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”',\n '',\n 'There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I',\n 'wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the',\n 'roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and',\n 'Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”',\n '',\n '“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,',\n 'for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the',\n 'window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to',\n 'this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that',\n 'again!” which produced another dead silence.',\n '',\n 'Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into',\n 'little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her',\n 'head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make',\n '_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it',\n 'must make me smaller, I suppose.”',\n '',\n 'So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she',\n 'began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get',\n 'through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of',\n 'little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,',\n 'was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it',\n 'something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she',\n 'appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself',\n 'safe in a thick wood.',\n '',\n '“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she',\n 'wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the',\n 'second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that',\n 'will be the best plan.”',\n '',\n 'It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply',\n 'arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea',\n 'how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among',\n 'the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a',\n 'great hurry.',\n '',\n 'An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and',\n 'feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little',\n 'thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to',\n 'it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it',\n 'might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in',\n 'spite of all her coaxing.',\n '',\n 'Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and',\n 'held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off',\n 'all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,',\n 'and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,',\n 'to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the',\n 'other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head',\n 'over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was',\n 'very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every',\n 'moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then',\n 'the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very',\n 'little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely',\n 'all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with',\n 'its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.',\n '',\n 'This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she',\n 'set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,',\n 'and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.',\n '',\n '“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant',\n 'against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the',\n 'leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d',\n 'only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that',\n 'I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I',\n 'suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great',\n 'question is, what?”',\n '',\n 'The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at',\n 'the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that',\n 'looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.',\n 'There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as',\n 'herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and',\n 'behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what',\n 'was on the top of it.',\n '',\n 'She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the',\n 'mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue',\n 'caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly',\n 'smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of',\n 'anything else.',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'CHAPTER V.',\n 'Advice from a Caterpillar',\n '',\n '',\n 'The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in',\n 'silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and',\n 'addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.',\n '',\n '“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.',\n '',\n 'This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,',\n 'rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know',\n 'who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been',\n 'changed several times since then.”',\n '',\n '“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain',\n 'yourself!”',\n '',\n '“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m',\n 'not myself,
